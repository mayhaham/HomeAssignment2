          <h2>ü§ù Volunteering</h2>
          <p>One of the most meaningful experiences in my life has been volunteering with Holocaust survivors. Listening to their stories, offering companionship, and contributing to preserving their memory has deeply shaped my values. It was humbling and fulfilling, and taught me the power of empathy and human connection.</p>

          <p>Exploration is my passion. I recently spent five unforgettable months traveling through South America.

Traveling continues to inspire my creativity and open my mind to different ways of living.</p>
